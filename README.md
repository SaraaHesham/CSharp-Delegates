# CSharp-Delegates
This repository features three C# projects that explore advanced concepts of Delegates, Anonymous Methods, Lambda Expressions, Multicast Delegates, Func/Action/Predicate, Events, and Covariance/Contravariance. Each project provides a hands-on approach to implementing these concepts in real-world applications.
