# CSharp-Delegates

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains three C# projects that demonstrate advanced concepts of **Delegates, Anonymous Methods, Lambda Expressions, Multicast Delegates, Func/Action/Predicate, Events, and Covariance/Contravariance**. Each project showcases how these concepts can be applied to real-world applications.

## 📚 Student Grading System
### Description
The **Student Grading System** is a console-based application built in **C#** to evaluate student performance using delegates. The project showcases the practical use of **Func, Action, and Predicate** to process and analyze student grades efficiently.

### 🎯 Features
- **Student Data Management:** Add students and enter their grades.
- **Grade Calculation:** Compute students' average grades dynamically.
- **Pass/Fail Evaluation:** Determine students' results based on predefined grading criteria.
- **Flexible Delegates:** Uses **Func, Action, and Predicate** for efficient grade processing.
- **Console-Based Interface:** Simple and interactive user experience.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **.NET Console Application**
- **Delegates (Func, Action, Predicate)**

### 📂 Project Structure
- `Program.cs` – Main entry point of the application.
- `Student.cs` – Represents student data including name, grades.
- `GradingSystem.cs` – Implements delegate-based grade processing logic.

## 🌡️ Temperature Sensor System  
### Description  
The **Temperature Sensor System** is a console-based application built in **C#** that monitors temperature changes using **events and delegates**. The project demonstrates the practical implementation of the **Observer pattern**, where multiple components (such as a display and an alarm) react to temperature updates in real time.  

### 🎯 Features  
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Continuously track and update temperature readings.  
- **Alarm System:** Alerts when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.  
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Uses C# events and delegates for real-time updates.  
- **User Interaction:** Allows users to set the temperature and configure the alarm threshold.  
- **Console-Based Interface:** Provides a simple and interactive user experience.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **C#**  
- **.NET Console Application**  
- **Events & Delegates** (Observer Pattern)  

### 📂 Project Structure  
- `Program.cs` – Main entry point of the application, handles user input.  
- `Sensor.cs` – Generates temperature changes and notifies subscribers.  
- `TemperatureArgs.cs` – Defines event data for temperature updates.  
- `Display.cs` – Displays real-time temperature updates.  
- `Alarm.cs` – Triggers an alert when the temperature exceeds a set limit.
